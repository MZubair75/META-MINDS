# =========================================================
# This module implements SMART methodology for generating high-quality,
# open-ended analytical questions that are:
# - Specific: Target distinct variables or trends
# - Measurable: Refer to quantifiable outcomes  
# - Action-Oriented: Use verbs that prompt analysis
# - Relevant: Relate to data context and stakeholder interests
# - Time-Bound: Reference periods or change over time

QUESTION DIVERSITY FRAMEWORK - Distribute questions across these categories:

📊 DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS (3-4 questions):
- Statistical summaries and distributions of {', '.join(numeric_cols[:2]) if numeric_cols else 'key metrics'}
- Data quality patterns and completeness
- Outlier identification in {', '.join(numeric_cols[:2]) if numeric_cols else 'main variables'}

🔍 COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS (3-4 questions):
- Performance comparisons across {', '.join(categorical_cols[:2]) if categorical_cols else 'available segments'}
- Benchmarking and ranking analysis
- Cross-segment efficiency evaluation

📈 PATTERN ANALYSIS (2-3 questions):
{"- Temporal trends and seasonality in " + ', '.join(numeric_cols[:2]) if has_time_data and numeric_cols else "- Cross-sectional patterns and distributions"}
{"- Forecasting potential for key metrics" if has_time_data else "- Correlation structures between variables"}
{"- Change detection and growth analysis" if has_time_data else "- Variance and stability patterns"}

🎯 BUSINESS IMPACT (3-4 questions):
- {context.subject_area} performance implications
- Risk factors and mitigation strategies
- Strategic decision-making insights
- Operational optimization opportunities

🔗 RELATIONSHIP DISCOVERY (2-3 questions):
- Variable interdependencies and correlations
- Causal relationships and drivers
- Interaction effects between {', '.join(categorical_cols[:2]) if len(categorical_cols) >= 2 else 'key factors'}

MANDATORY VARIETY RULES:
- Use different question starters: "How does...", "What factors...", "Which segments...", "Why might...", "To what extent..."
- Focus on specific column names: {', '.join(df.columns[:4])}
- Apply different analytical lenses: performance, efficiency, growth, risk, optimization
- Avoid repetitive patterns like "What are the trends..." or "How does X change over time..."

        return """You are an expert data analyst and question generation specialist. Your role is to create high-quality, DIVERSE, OPEN-ENDED analytical questions that strictly follow SMART methodology (Specific, Measurable, Action-Oriented, Relevant, Time-Bound).

CRITICAL DIVERSITY & OPEN-ENDED REQUIREMENTS:
- ALL questions MUST be open-ended to encourage deep exploration and analysis
- MUST use DIVERSE question structures and analytical approaches
- AVOID repetitive patterns like "What are the trends..." or "How does X correlate with Y..."
- Use varied question starters: "Which factors...", "To what extent...", "Why might...", "How do different..."
- Start with open-ended words: What, How, Why, In what ways, To what extent, Which factors, How do, What patterns, What insights
- NEVER use closed-ended starters like: Is, Are, Does, Do, Will, Would, Can, Could, Should
- Each question should invite detailed exploration, multiple perspectives, and comprehensive analysis
- Avoid questions that can be answered with yes/no, true/false, or simple one-word responses

SMART + OPEN-ENDED Principles:
1. **Specific + Open-Ended**: Target distinct variables while asking "What specific patterns..." or "How do specific factors..."
2. **Measurable + Exploratory**: Reference quantifiable outcomes while asking "What measurable trends..." or "How do metrics reveal..."
3. **Action-Oriented + Investigative**: Use analytical verbs in exploratory format: "How can we analyze..." or "What factors should be evaluated..."
4. **Relevant + Contextual**: Ensure questions relate to business context: "What insights about [business area]..." or "How do [relevant factors]..."
5. **Time-Bound + Temporal**: Include temporal dimensions: "What trends over [time period]..." or "How have patterns evolved..."

EXAMPLES:
✅ EXCELLENT: "What specific trends in customer acquisition can be identified over the past 12 months, and how do these patterns vary across different marketing channels?"
✅ EXCELLENT: "How do seasonal variations impact sales performance across different product categories, and what factors contribute to these cyclical patterns?"
❌ AVOID: "Is customer acquisition increasing?" (Closed-ended)
❌ AVOID: "Do sales vary by season?" (Closed-ended)

Your questions should enable analysts to uncover actionable insights through comprehensive exploration and detailed investigation."""

Each comparison question MUST:

2. **Measurable**: Reference quantifiable differences, ratios, or comparative metrics
3. **Action-Oriented**: Use comparative analytical verbs (compare, contrast, evaluate differences)
4. **Relevant**: Focus on cross-dataset insights that drive business decisions
5. **Time-Bound**: Include temporal comparisons where applicable

**Focus Areas:**
- Performance metric comparisons across datasets
- Trend pattern similarities and differences
- Relationship strength variations between datasets
- Anomaly patterns across different data sources
- Cross-dataset correlation opportunities
