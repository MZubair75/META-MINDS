🔄 CROSS-DATASET COMPARISON QUESTIONS
================================================================================

🎯 These questions explore relationships, patterns, and insights
   that emerge when analyzing your datasets together:

 1. What specific anomalies are present when comparing the year-on-year changes in current assets, current liabilities, and financial ratios from 2018 to 2023, and how might these anomalies impact the company's strategic risk assessment for the upcoming fiscal year?

 2. How can the yearly trends from the financial ratios dataset be cross-analyzed against the current assets and liabilities datasets to identify potential areas of financial vulnerability for the next two fiscal years?

 3. What specific risk assessment insights can be drawn from a comparative analysis of the year-to-year changes in assets and liabilities, specifically focusing on liquidity patterns over the last five years?

 4. How do the specific patterns identified in the assets and liabilities datasets over the past five years align or diverge from the company's overall financial health indicators shown in the ratios dataset?

 5. In what specific ways does the year-to-year comparison of assets and liabilities datasets influence the company's understanding of its financial stability and consequent risk mitigation strategies?

 6. What specific patterns emerge from the year-to-year changes in financial ratios, and how do these trends correspond with the changes observed in assets and liabilities over the same time period?

 7. What insights can be gleaned from the correlation between financial ratios and the balance between current assets and liabilities over the past five years, and how might these insights inform executive decision-making?

 8. To what exact degree do the trends in financial ratios over the last five years mirror the changes observed in the assets and liabilities datasets, and what implications might this have on future investment strategies?

 9. How have the specific trends in assets and liabilities evolved over the last five years, and how might these trends impact the company's risk profile assessment for the next fiscal year?

10. Considering the company's overall financial health, how do the annual changes in assets contrast with the changes in liabilities over the last five years, and what potential strategic risks might this reveal for upcoming business decisions?
